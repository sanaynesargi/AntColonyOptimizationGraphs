# **Ant Colony Optimization v1**

### By: Sanay Nesargi

## Description

This simple Godot project is meant to be an implementaiton of the Ant Colony Optimizaiton algorithm for the Travelling Salesman Problem. While it's not 100% optimized, it did serve as a great starter project in Godot 2D, and I will be making another implementation extending to a more real-world scenario of ants foraging to find food.
